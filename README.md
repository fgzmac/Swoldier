# Workout App

A documentation foundation and isolated Lock Screen proof for an iPhone-first workout tracker. **Workout App** is the ChatGPT project; [Swoldier](https://github.com/fgzmac/Swoldier) is the GitHub repository. The app's public name remains open.

The goal is to make logging a workout quick: follow a routine, enter the sets you actually perform, change exercises when needed, and review progress over time. Your own BodySpec scans can become a later progress resource.

## Verified foundation status — 2026-11-09

- Working folder: D:\SwoldierApp. Source preserved at C:\Users\bbdaw\OneDrive\Desktop\WorkoutApp\workout-app-starter.
- All 8 relative filenames and SHA-256 hashes matched immediately after copying and before editing. README and AGENTS are at the root; no nested starter folder.
- Earlier local inspection verified Windows 11 Home, native PowerShell, and 32 GB installed RAM.
- During foundation setup, the tool versions were: Git 2.55.0.windows.4; Node.js v24.19.0; npm 11.17.0; VS Code 1.145.2 x64; Codex CLI 0.167.0-alpha.3.2.
- During foundation setup, D: was rechecked as exFAT, Healthy / OK. The user supplied diagnostic results reporting no problems and exit 0. Separately, the earlier assistant-run /markclean check returned 0 and cleared the dirty flag. The original cause remains unknown. No repair was repeated during migration.
- The foundation was pushed previously. A read-only check on 2026-11-10 confirmed that GitHub main still points to 75a4c62aefeb27dfdfbb7c3b5e87ad307115cbd4. Local main tracked origin/main and was clean at the start of the checkpoint.
- Production framework remains undecided. This foundation snapshot predates the isolated proof; see its current status below.
- Local files, GitHub, and ChatGPT uploads do not synchronize automatically.

## Current proof status

The [one-set proof](proofs/lock-screen/README.md) has Expo and native Swift source. Windows SQL, TypeScript, dependency, and JavaScript export checks passed. The SQL tests use the production statements through a separate JavaScript transaction wrapper; they do not execute the Swift implementation. Swift compilation, signing, installation, and all iPhone checks are **Not run**. Device and account prerequisites remain in [the handoff](docs/HANDOFF.md).

## Start here

1. Read [the current handoff](docs/HANDOFF.md) for the phase, verified state, and exact next task.
2. Read [the project plan](docs/PROJECT.md) for product direction and decisions, and [learning and setup](docs/LEARNING_AND_SETUP.md) for environment guidance.
3. Review the [proof instructions](proofs/lock-screen/README.md) and [feasibility plan](docs/LOCK_SCREEN_FEASIBILITY.md), then follow the handoff for account readiness.
4. For later coding tasks, check the result yourself, explain the main change in your own words, and update [the build log](docs/BUILD_LOG.md).

Keep these documents beside the isolated proof code. Keep one main copy of the project so that code, decisions, and progress stay together.

## A simple rule for progress

**Planned** means written down. **Implemented** means code exists. **Verified** means a named check was actually run and passed. Record those states separately.

Use fictional data in shared examples. Put personal scans and other private data in `private_data/` if you keep them inside the project. The ignore rule helps prevent accidental commits; it does not encrypt files or remove files that Git already tracks.
